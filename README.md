# pipeline-resting-preproc

This repository includes our snakefile and scripts involved with processing BIDS formatted resting data primarily using SPM, in preparation for use in the CONN toolbox. This pipeline mirrors the task2rest pipeline in every way, only that the preprocessing starts with resting scan data, and thus no L1 models/residuals are involved

More details here to follow RE: snakemake, containers, general design logic, etc...
